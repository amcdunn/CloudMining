[IMDb][1] and [MEDLINE][2]. 

The [DBLP][3] dataset was augmented with tags and citations from
[CiteSeerX][7]. Only a sample dataset of the top 10,000 most cited articles is
provided here. The [IMDb][4] instance is made of the top 400 best rated movies.
The [MEDLINE][4] dataset is made of the 10,000 most cited articles. For the
